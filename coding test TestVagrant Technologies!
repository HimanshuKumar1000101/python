Q1 - 1. Calculate the total amount to be paid to the shop-keeper 

def total_amountt():
    product=['Leather wallet','Umbrella','Cigarette','Honey']
    Unit_Price=[1100,900,200,100]
    GST=[0.18,0.12,0.28,0]
    Quantity=[1,2,3,4]
    for i in (0, len(product)-1):
        total_amount=(Unit_Price[i]*Quantity[i])+(Unit_Price[i]*Quantity[i])*GST[i]
        print("total_amount",total_amount)
totalToPay = total_amountt()
